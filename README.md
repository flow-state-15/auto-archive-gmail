# Automating gmail functions

This is a little script to automate archiving pages in the gmail webapp. It
starts from the page the script is run and works its way forward.

The script attempts to find the page global checkbox, archive div and forward
div, then clicks them all in sequence with pauses.

## to use

Copy contents of `script.js` and pasate into the console of your browser, then
press 'enter'. Find the console
by: `right click in window > inspect > console tab`.
